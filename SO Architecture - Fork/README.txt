This is a fork of the SO - Architecture from the Unity Store. https://github.com/DanielEverland/ScriptableObject-Architecture
Recent updates to the project have resulted in integral features being removed or broken (developer descriptions, stack trace, and 
"changes in editor cause events to be raised").

This version is likely coupled to other scripts in this package.
